# 05. Java Loops
# While

Loops through a block of code on a specific condition and compiles only if the typed test is true.

```java
int i=0;

while (i<5){
System.out.println(i);
i++;
}

// Gonna start count 0 to 4
```

## Changing the flow of the loop

There are two ways to change the flow of a loop, namely, with continue and break. Example in practice:

```java
int cc = 0;
while (cc<10){
    cc++;
    if (cc == 5 || cc == 7){
        continue;
    }
    System.out.println ("The counter counted: "+cc);
}
```

In the example above, the counter will count up to 10, however, skipping numbers 5 and 7, as it was determined that the flow would continue normally without those numbers inside the if. In the example of a break, like:

```java
if (cc == 5 || cc == 7){
    break;
}
```

The code would only count up to number 4, as 5 was the limit set in the logical test of the if conditional structure.

# Do-While

The Do While loop structure is a bit different. The code will do some logical process, while a logical test is true. Example:

```java
int n, s=0;
String resp;
Scanner keyboard = new Scanner (System.in);
do {
    System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
    n = keyboard.nextInt ();
    s += n; // or s + s = n
    System.out.print ("Want to continue? [Y/N]");
    resp = keyboard.next ();
} while (resp.equals("Y"));{
    System.out.print ("The sum of all values is: "+s);
}
```

In the example cited, the user, through the Scanner, will enter a number and while the answer to continue entering the values is Y, the do will run the sum command block and ask again. When the user responds with a false value, the sum of the entered values will be returned and the program ends the compilation.
# For 

Loops as a while, but with many time you want, if you know how much the code gonna work.

**Syntax**:

```java
for (statement1; statement2; statement3){
// Stat1 is executed (one time) before the executation of the code;

// Stat2 define the condition for executation the code;

// Stat3 is executed (every time) after the block has been executed.
}
```

Example:

```java
for (int i=0; i<5; i++){
System.out.println (i); //gonna print from 0 to 4 because of statement 2
}
```

# For-Each

Is a loop to support exclusively elements in an array.

**Structure example**:

```java
for (type variableName: arrayName){
}
```

**Example in practice**:

```java
String [] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW"}; 

for (String i:cars){
System.out.println (i);
}
```

#### Array
Is used to store multiple value in a single variable.

Syntax: 
- type **square brackets** name;

**Example**:

```java
String [] cars;
```

and/or:

```java
cars = {"Volvo", "BMW"};
```
 
You can change array element. Like:

```java
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW"};
cars[0] = "Opel";
System.out.println(cars [0]); // Volvo has turned into Opel
```

To count the elements inside on Array, you must use the length property. Ex:

```java
String [] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW"}; 
System.out.println(cars.length); //output the list
```

# For loop + Array:

You can loop through an array and using length to specify how many elements and times the loop gonna run.

```java
String for (int i=0; i<cars.length; i++){
System.out.println(cars [i]);
}
```

For-Each example:

```java
for (String i : cars){
System.out.println(i);
}
```

### Observation:
**i** means index.
