# 07. Methods

Methods is a block which runs only when is called. They are small snippets of code that model a program, that is, they are small snippets of programs that together form a system.
The methods without return are called **void** or **procedures** and those with return are called **functions** (they are defined with **primitive types**).
- **Are** used to recycle a code;
- **Must** be declared within a class.

Example:

```java
public class Main{
static void myMethod {
//code
}
```

- ``myMethod()`` is the name of the method;
- ``static`` means that the method belongs to  the ``Main`` class and is not an object of Main class.
- ``void`` means that this method don't return value.

##### Difference between method without return and with return
- The method **without return** is named this way because it only executes the instructions that are within its command blocks, regardless of the type.

- With **return**, will only respond to their calls in other classes by the determination of their **primitive type**.

## Method parameters

Information can be passed as **parameter**, because parameters act like variables inside the method. Also can be add many parameters you want and they are specified after the method name.

Example:

```java
public class Main {

static void myMethod(String Fname){
System.out.println(fname+"Jones");
}

public static void main (String[] args){
myMethod ("Liam");
myMethod ("Jenny");
}

}
/* Output: 
Liam Jones 
Jenny Jones
*/
```

You can also have many parameters you want in a method. Example:

```java
static void myMetod (String fname, int age){
System.out.println(fname + "is"+ age);
}

public static void main (String [] args){
myMethod ("Liam", 5)
}

/*Output:
Liam is 5
*/
```

As you know, the keyword void shouldn't return value. To do this, you can use a primitive data type, and instead void, use return. Example:

```java
static int myMethod (int x) {
return 5+x;
}

public static void main (String args []){
System.out.println(myMethod (3));
} 

//Output: 8 (5+3)
```

You can do also:

```java
static int myMethod (int x, int y) {
//code
}

//OR

static int myMethod (int x, y) {
//code
}
```

## Method Overloading

Multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters. Example:

Instead of:

```java
static int plusMethodInt(int x, int y){
return x+y;
}

//and

static double plusMethodDouble(double x, double y){
return x+y;
}
```

You can:

```java
static int plusMethod(int x, int y){
return x+y;
}

//and

static double plusMethod(double x, double y){
return x+y;
}
```

Example extended:

```java
static int plusMethodInt(int x, int y){
return x+y;
}

//and

static double plusMethodDouble(double x, double y){
return x+y;
}

public static void main (String args []){
int numn1 = plusMethod(8, 5);
double num2 = plusMethod(4.3, 5.7); 

System.out.println(num1);
System.out.println(num2);
} 
```

## Java Recursion 

Is the technique of making
a function call itself - provides a way to break complicated problems. Example adding several numbers.

```java
public class Main { 
public static void (String [] args){
int result = sum (10); System.out.println (result); // Count 10+ all numbers under himself. Like: 10+9+8+7... until 0.
}

public static int sum(int k){
return k+sum (k-1); // Sum 10 to another number smaller than him
else {
return 0;
}
// Ðžutput: 55
```


To select a specific counter, this code can also be writs like:

```java
int result = sum(5, 10);
System.out.println(result);
  }

  public static int sum(int start, int end) {
  
    if (end > start) {
      return end + sum(start, end - 1);
    } else {
      return end;
    }

}

/*
Explaining: start = 5 and end = 10, so... 5+6+7+8+9+10=45
Output: 45
*/
````

## Public vs. Static

Have no secrets create a method. Let's start with simple example:

```java
public class Main { 
static void myMethod (){
System.out.println ("Hello!");
}
}
```

You also can call this method inside another class like ``myMethod();`` but, there's a difference when it's ``static`` and ``public``. Public methods **must** be called by creating objects and Static **can** be called **without** them. For example:

```java
static void myStaticMethod()
public void myPublicMethod()

// CAN be called without create a class object
myStaticMethod(); //Call the static method

// MUST be called by creating a object
Main myObj = new Main(); //Create an object of Main
myObj.myPublicMethod(); //Call the public method
```

Example extended:

```java
public class Main {
  // Static method
  static void myStaticMethod() {
    System.out.println("Static methods can be called without creating objects");
  }

  // Public method
  public void myPublicMethod() {
    System.out.println("Public methods must be called by creating objects");
  }

  // Main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myStaticMethod(); // Call the static method

    Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of Main
    myObj.myPublicMethod(); // Call the public method
  }
}

```
