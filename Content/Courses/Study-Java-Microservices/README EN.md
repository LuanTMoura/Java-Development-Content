# Studies on Spring Framework
In this repository I seek to attach content that I learned about Microservices.
All content that is annotated will be in the Markdown file [at this link](https://github.com/LuanTMoura/Java-Development-Content/blob/main/Content/Courses/Study-Java-Microservices/Java%20Microservices.md). Finally, all support files and used as examples of learning sources will be in the repository where you are reading this text.
