MySQL - Curso em VÃ­deo  Aula 04

01.
To delete some database, you use the command: 

	drop database databasename; or CTRL+ENTER;

02.
There is a parameter called Constraint, that is used to limit the type of data that can go into a table and digited after create database. 
The command to set this parameter is: default character set utf8 
(utf8 is always lowercase and used for LATAM characters)

03.
Collations are used to organize characters and set by the command default collate utf8_general_ci;

04.
The constraint NOT NULL is used to force the user to set something on a field (like a name) and you digit after the field type.

05.
Birth can be defined by the type: date.

06.
When we are using the type >enum<, this means that the user has only the parameters defined by the table to choose from. Example:

	sex enum ('M', 'F');

07.
And now, when we define something with the type >decimal<, we decide a number
that gonna be set before and after a comma. 
Example: 

	decimal (5,2) -> Five spaces of digits and two spaces of digits after comma 

(so, it's possible to digit a number like "147,56").

08.
The constraint DEFAULT is used to set optional choices if the user doesn't have something
to digit. Like:

	nationality varchar (20) DEFAULT 'Brasil'.

08.
After creating the fields inside the table, we close the line of command with
DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8;

09.
To differentiate a register, we use a PRIMARY KEY, that creates different registers
to similar fields, like a name. Generally used with int.

10.
There is a constraint to creating a register after another already created
and is called AUTO_INCREMENT.

11.
Using both tips above, we create "id" to differentiate registers, for example:

	"id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT" and at the final of definition em digit "PRIMARY KEY (id)".

12.
Constraints are separated by an "_".
