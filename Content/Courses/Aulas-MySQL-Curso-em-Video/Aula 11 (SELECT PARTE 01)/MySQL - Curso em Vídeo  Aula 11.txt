The asterisks from SELECT * FROM means every column.

02. 
We can select a table ordering by specific columns, like:
select * from course order by name;

03. 
Also, we can select descending items. Example:

	select * from course order by name desc; 
	- desc as a command is describe and desc as
	a parameter is descending.

And asc as a parameter is ascending.

04.
We also can filter the column's name by their specifications.
Example: select nome, carga, ano from cursos order by nome;
Which implies changing the order in other ways, for example:

	select ano, carga, nome from cursos order by ano, nome;

05.
To filter by lines, we add the WHERE before
the ORDER BY to specify parameters. Example:
select * from cursos where ano = '2016' order by nome;
To limit by specific columns, we do the same as
the example above:

	select nome, carga from cursos where ano = '2016' order by nome;

06.
We also can use relational operators to filter by some specific
terms. Example:
	select nome, descricao from cursos where ano <= '2015' order by nome;
	select nome, descricao from cursos where ano >= '2015' order by nome;
	select nome, descricao from cursos where ano = '2015' order by nome;
	select nome, descricao from cursos where ano < '2015' order by nome;
	select nome, descricao from cursos where ano > '2015' order by nome;
	select nome, descricao from cursos where ano != '2015' order by nome;

07.
There is another operator that we can use, it's similar to
BETWEEN and he is called IN. The difference between them is:
You filter BETWEEN and the data will be all of the parameters inside
at this condition. And IN will limited by the specific parameter requested. Example:
	select nome, ano from cursos where ano between 2014 and 2016 order by ano desc, nome asc;
	select nome, ano from cursos where ano in (2014, 2016) order by ano desc, nome asc;

08.
And to finish, it's possible to use logical operators with select. Example:
	select nome, carga, totaulas from cursos where carga > 35 and totaulas < 30;
	select nome, carga, totaulas from cursos where carga > 35 or totaulas < 30;

09.
Select is classified as Data Query Language, which means a language for questions.
In other words, he selects data and operates what is requested (questioned).
