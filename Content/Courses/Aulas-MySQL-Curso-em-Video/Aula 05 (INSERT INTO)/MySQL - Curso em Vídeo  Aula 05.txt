MySQL - Curso em VÃ­deo  Aula 05

01.
DDL which means Data Definition Language, implies that CREATE DATABASE and CREATE TABLE are DDL commands or commands of definition. Example: to create a table, we use a command to do this, in other words, DDL.

02.
Date on MySQL is the contrary to date on Brazil (Year, month, and day) and written with a trace, like:

	year-month-day.

03.
When we create a value with auto increment as a primary key, we don't need to input anything with INSERT INTO to register a field.

04.
To show everything in a table, we use a command select from. Example:

	select * from people.

05.
If we create a field predefined like an ID with auto_icrement or something like a nationality with a default name, we use the INSERT INTO with DEFAULT. Example:

	insert into people
	(name, birth, gender, weight, nationality)
	values
	('Pedrinho','2020-05-18','M','15.4',DEFAULT);

06.
It's unnecessary to name the order of values that gonna be inserted before the insert, as long as the inputs are in order of table. Example:

	insert into people values (...);

07.
As long as the data are separated by command and dot comma at the final, it's possible to add more than one register inside the table. Example:

	insert into people values (...), (...), (...);

08.
The INSERT INTO command is a DML command, which means Data Manipulation Language.
