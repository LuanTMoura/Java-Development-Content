MySQL - Curso em VÃ­deo  Aula 14

01.
The Relational Model of databases means that every data has a relationship with each other and meanings with themselves.
Example: 
		Table person: his attributes;
		Table market: hist attributes;
		Both databases can be connected with a specific relationship: with orders for example and how much this affects the slot.

02.
Every group of data with several pieces of information is called **Entity**. And data is equal to **Attribute**.

03.
Data are represented as Attributes, and these attributes gonna represent Tuples, Registers, and Information stored inside Entities. 

04.
And between an entity and another, there will be a Relationship. They are represented by a diamond - As the entity is represented rectangle.

05.
There are several types of relationships: ternary, quaternary, etc. And the example above is a double relationship.

06.
This diagram is called Diagram Entity-Relationship, Diagram E-R, or just DER.

07.
And there's a way to represent how attributes can be connected. For example: a person can watch several (n) courses and courses can be watched by several (n) people.

And this "n" is called cardinality, which means attributes can have one or more relationships.

08.
There's a simple type of relationship called one-to-one. And can be represented as:

[IMAGE FROM DESKTOP]

09.
Also exist the relationship one-to-many, represented as:

[IMAGE FROM DESKTOP]

10.
So, the first example can be named as many-to-many.

11.
When a primary key is passed for another entity that already has a PK, they gonna be called a foreign key, as a "copy" of a primary key that went from outside.

12.
When we define the types of a primary key and pass as a foreign key, they MUST be the same to match each other. Example: 
		cpf-esposo int;
		cpf-esposa int;

13.
As a technique meaning, we define a dominant entity and pass a foreign key to another entity.
Examples:

[IMAGE FROM DESKTOP]

[IMAGE FROM DESKTOP]

And, when there's a many-to-many relationship, we transform the relationship represented as a diamond into a rectangle, in other words, another entity. With the relationship with each entity separated, we create a conjunction of relationships of one-to-many:
