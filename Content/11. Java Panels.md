# 11. Java Panels
A Graphic Interface (or Panel) can control every pixel from a window and his attributes like color, size, ser image and buttons etc.
To import packages of graphic interfaces, you must call the following Java API's:

```java
import java.awt.*; //Abstract windows interfaces
import java.awt.event.*; //Clicks treatment
import javax.swing.*; // Interface's model
```

To use methods from a panel, you extends an class called ``JPanel``. Example:

```java
private Interface extends JPanel {
// Attributes
}
```

- There are a plench of attributes that a ``JPanel`` can supply, like button, box selection, radio button, scrollbar etc.
- ``JLabel`` is a class to carries texts, images and ``ImageIcon`` is a class to manipulate images. Example:

```java
private JLabel label1, label2;
private ImageIcon img1;

/*
private = classifier
JLabel, ImageIcon = class
label1 and 2, img1 = object
*/
```

To starting create a interface, you create a **constructor** to initialize components.
Example:

```java
public Interface {
initializeComponents();
}
```

- "``initializeComponents();``" is a method that define attributes to a panel (and it's been called to a constructor to be showed for the user).
