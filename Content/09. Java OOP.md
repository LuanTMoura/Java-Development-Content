# 09. Java OOP

Procedural programming is a step by step with methods that operates something with data, OOP creates objects that contain data and methods.
- Classes and Objects, everything in Java have classes and objects, and those things are accompanied with attributes and methods. Ex: car -> the object.
	- his attributes color, weight etc.
	- methods drive, turn on/off etc.
- Example creating a class and an object:

```java
// The class is Main and object is myObs. public class Main
public class Main{
int x = 5; 

public static void main(String [] args){
Main myObj = new Main();
System.out.println(myObj.x);
}

}

//Output: 5
```

To create multiple objects is simple. Following the example below, you just do something like:

```java
Main myObj1 = new Main ();
Main myObj2 = new Main ();
```

## Using multiple classes

Let's create a class called ``Second`` for example. We gonna take something. like:

```java
public class Main { // Main.java
int x = 5;
}

class Second { // Second.java
public static void main(String [] args){
Main myObj = new Main ();
System.out.println (myObj.x);
}
}
```


#### Class attributes 

Class attributes are variables within a class. Like the example used, ``x`` is an attribute of ``Main``. And to access an attribute, we instantiate using an  "``.``" with an object created, for example:

```java
Main myObj = new Main(); // Object
System.out.println(myObj.x); // Instance 
```


To modify attribute is simples. Using the example ``int = 5`;``, you just do:

```java
Main myObj = new Main(); 
myObj.x = 40;
```

To cancel someone replace attributes, you declare them as ``final``. Example:

```java
public class Main{
final int x = 10;
}
```

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is used to make sure that sensitive data is hidden from users.
So you **must**:
- declare class variable/attributes as private;
- create ``get`` and ``set`` methods to access and update the value of a private variable.

Example:

```java
public class Person {
  private String name; // private = restricted access

// Getter
public String getName() {
return name;
}

// Setter
public void setName(String newName) {
this.name = newName;
}
}
```

- method ``get`` return the value of variable name;
- method ``set`` takes a parameter ``newName`` and replace/assign value in ``name`` variable;
- "``this``" is used to refer to the current object. So, if ``name`` is declared as ``private``, to access from another class is simple.

Instead of:

```java
public class Main{
public static void main (String[] args){
Person myObj = new Person();
myObj.name = "John"; //error
System.out.println (myObj.name); //error
}
```

We use ``get`` and ``set`` to:

```java
Persn myObj = new Person();

myObj.setName("John"); //Set the value of the name variable to "John"

System.out.println(myObj.getName()); //Get and print the value inside the object
```

## Inheritance

Make it possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another, and they classified by:

- Subclass (child) - inherits from a class;
- Superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from.

To inherit a class, we use ``extend`` keyword.

Car example again:

```java
class Vehicle {
protected String brand = "Ford"; //Atributte

public void honk(){ //Method
System.out.println("Tuut, Tuut!");
}
}
```

Another class:

```java
class Car extends Vehicle {
private String modelName = "Mustang";//Car atribut–µ

public static void main (String[] args){

//Create myCar object
Car myCar = new Car ();

//Call the honk() method (from Vehicle class) on myCar object
myCar.honk(); 

//Print
System.out.println(myCar.brand + " " + myCar.modelName);

}
}
```
