# 08. Java Modifiers
Modifiers are keyword that set levels to methods and classes access (also objects).
Modifiers are separated into two groups:

- **Access Modifiers** - controls the access level;
- **Non-Access Modifiers** - do not control access level, but have their own functions.

Example:

|Modifier|Description|
|---|---|
|`public`|The class is accessible by any other class. For attributes, methods and constructors, the code is accessible for all classes.|
|`private`|The code is only accessible within the declared class.|
|`default`|The class is only accessible by classes in the same package. This is used when you don’t specify a modifier. For attributes, methods and constructors, the code is only accessible in the same package.|
|`protected`|The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses.|

## Non-Access Modifiers

|Modifier|Description|
|---|---|
|`final`|The class cannot be inherited by other classes. For attributes and methods, they cannot be overridden/modified.|
|`static`|Attributes and methods belong to the class, rather than an object.|
|`abstract`|Can only be used in an abstract class, and can only be used on methods. The method does not have a body, for example `abstract void run();`. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).|
|`transient`|Attributes and methods are skipped when serializing the object containing them.|
|`synchronized`|Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time.|
|`volatile`|The value of an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the “main memory”.|

``Final`` also used lock to values like ``PI``.
