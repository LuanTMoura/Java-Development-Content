# 03. Java Type Casting

Type casting means replace some primitive type to another data type. There's orders to do this, and they are: **Widening casting** (*Smaller to larger*) and **Narrowing casting** (*Larger to smaller*).

Example:

```java
public class Main { public static void main(String.
){ 
// Widening
int myInt = 9;
double myDouble = myInt;

//Narrowing
int myInt2 = (int) myDouble2;
double myDouble2 = 9.78d;
my Int);//9

/* Output:
System.out.println(my Double); //9.0
System.out.println(myInt); //9
System.out.println(myInt2); //9
System.out.println(myDouble2); //.78d */
```
